# Design of integrated circuits - MAC Unit
This MAC-unit was designed as part of a student project. Here you can view it's design and implemetation, and simulation results. Full project report can be read at: [PLACEHOLDER]. 

## Repository structure
Primary directories are *spice* and *verilog*. Under spice you will find all circuit and model files used for transistor simulations. Verilog contains the design and verification of the hardware at gate and system level.

- **verilog**
    - **simulations** - simulation results.
    - **src** - circuits implemented at gate level.
    - **testbench** - testbenches for circuits.
